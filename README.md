# The-ultimate-Soccer-database-for-data-analysis-and-machine-learning

- It s my very first Machine learning project trying to apply what we I ve learned during the semester in a Course named " introduction to AI and ML " we studied some general ideas , classical AI and we tackled some Machine learning throughout KNN , Perceptron , Kernels Trick , Decision Tree and Random forests !
It was proposed by Professor Ludovic Denoyer ( Sorbonne University LIP6 ) to  get-in-touch with Machine learning and AI 

- I've tried through this project to analyze some interesting topics whithin soccer data  , the data was downloaded from this Kaggle Kernel  https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer
