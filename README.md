# Data-Science-and-machine-learning-project

a project given by Professor Ludovic Denoyer ( Sorbonne Unversity LIP6 )

I've tried in this project to analyse some interesting topics about soccer data 
the data was downloaded from this Kaggle Kernel  https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer
Actually , my notebooks are in French , I'll try to translate them as soon as possible .
